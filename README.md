# ThreePointCircle
Get the center point and the radius of a circle with three points

This program is based on the mathematical derivation of the circle equation using the unit circle and a system of equations with 3 unknowns. 
The derivation is rearranged so that the equation depends on only one unknown, so that it can be solved by the given points alone.

There are some conditions for setting up the circle equation with 3 points. 
- No double points
- 3 points do not lie on a common x or y straight line
